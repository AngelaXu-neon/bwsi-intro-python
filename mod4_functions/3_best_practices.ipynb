    "Practically, shorter functions are also easier to maintain, test, and debug if something breaks! Comments are wonderful, but if you find yourself writing long/multiline comments or creating sections using comments it might be time to package parts of the code as their own functions. Redundancy or increasing numbers of conditions are also signs that you should consider breaking up your code.\n",
