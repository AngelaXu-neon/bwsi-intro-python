    "#### Objects\n",
    "An `object` is a collection of data and methods. Objects can be used to represent complex, real-world entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, all data types are considered as objects, including the types we have already seen like integers, strings, and lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a `string` object is a collection of `characters` and has methods such as `.upper()` that we can call on the object. Likewise, `lists` are collections of data with methods like `.append()`."

    "#### Classes and Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is defined by a **class**. A class is like a blueprint for the object we want to create. \n",
    "\n",
    "An **instance** of an object is a specific example of an object. When you create a variable and assign it a value, you are creating an instance of that type (or class). For example, if you create a variable `greeting` and set it to `\"hello\"`, then `greeting` becomes an instance of the `str` class."

    "\n",
    "There are two types of attributes:\n",
    "1. **Class attributes**: shared across all instances of a class. They are defined within the class declaration. \n",
    "2. **Instance attributes**: unique to a specific instance of an object, usually defined within the `__init__` method (short for \"initialize\"). Instance attributes can differ from object to object. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, `name` and `major` are *class attributes* because they are defined directly in the class and apply to all instances of `PythonInstructor` objects. "
